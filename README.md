# NeverLeave2D
This is a 2d game I made using SDL. the game have 2-4 levels followed by a boss level. In this project I developed an component system, this includes a animation component and a collision componet. I also developed Ai that work off of a state machine, other things in this project that i deem noteable are:
-- A User interface

-- A Scene Manager

-- The ability to save your progress

-- A level editior

** I would say that this project was a precursor to my 2d game engine (ArksEngine) as it pretty much layed down some of the foundations that went into developing it.

Things I learned from this project:

-- The structure of the main game loop

-- State machines

-- Basic ai programming

-- SDL
